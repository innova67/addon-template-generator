## Addon Template Generator

addon template generator for minecraft bedrock 1.7.x alpha and 1.8.x beta

<https://innova67.github.io/template-generator>

> This generator won't generate a fully ended addon, it will just merge all the folders and files needed to start one.

### How does it works?
into the website you will find three principal sections to select:
1. common textures
2. common behaviors
3. fully customized mob addons (only for 1.8.x beta) **not implemented yet**

### using a common addons
choose **behavior** or **texture** and follow these steps:
  
#### BEHAVIORS.-
1. add your behavior's name
2. select basic files to be added (manifest, pack icon, trading ...)
3. choose the entity (or entities) to modify
  
#### TEXTURES.-
4. enable _models_ to modify entity's model
5. enable _items_ section if you want to modify item textures
  * choose wich items do you want to modify
6. enable _blocks_ section if you want to modify block textures
  * choose wich blocks do you want to modify
7. enbale _sound_ to modify entity's sound

_to modify texts and translations personally recomend SolveDev's Anylanguajes_ <https://solveddev.github.io/AnyLanguage/>

once all was selected click on **generate and download** to finish

### using customized mobs
this isn't implemented yet (sorry) :P
