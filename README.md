# Addon Template Generator

addon template generator for minecraft bedrock 1.7.x alpha and 1.8.x beta

<https://innova67.github.io/template-generator>

> **This generator won't generate a fully ended addon, it will just merge all the folders and files needed to start one.**

### How does it works?
into the website you will find three principal sections to select:
1. common textures
2. common behaviors
3. fully customized mob generator (only for 1.8.x beta) **not implemented yet**
---
### using common addon generator
choose **behavior** or **texture** and follow these steps:
  
#### BASIC CONTENT.-
1. add your pack's name
2. choose if you want to just `generate directories` or `generate directories and fill with vanilla files`
3. select basic files to be added (manifest, pack icon) 

**now, into the options you can choose:**

TEXTURES | BEHAVIORS
---------|-----------
enable `models` to modify entity's model | enable `trading` to modify villager's trading
enable `items` if you want to modify item textures | enable `loot tables` (and which loot tables)
enable `blocks` section if you want to modify block textures | choose the `entities` to modify
enable `sound` to modify entity's sound

_to modify texts and translations personally recommend **@SolveDev**'s [Any-languajes](https://solveddev.github.io/AnyLanguage/) generator_

once all was selected click on `generate and download` to finish

### using customized mobs
this isn't implemented yet (sorry) :P
