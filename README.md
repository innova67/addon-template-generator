## Addon Template Generator

addon template generator for minecraft bedrock 1.7.x alpha and 1.8.x beta
<https://innova67.github.io/template-generator>

> This generator won't generate a fully ended addon, it will just merge all the folders and files needed to start one.

### How does it works?
into the website you will find two principal sections to select:
1. common addons
2. fully customized mob addons (only for 1.8.x beta)

### using a common addons
choose **only behavior** or **only texture** or **addon** and follow these steps:
  
#### BEHAVIORS.-
  1. choose the entity (or entities) to modify
  2. enable _loot_tables_ to add it into the behavior
  3. aneble _trading_ to add it into the behavior
    * (it only works with entity villager)
  
#### TEXTURES.-
  4. enable _models_ to modify entity's model
  5. enable _items_ section if you want to modify item textures
    * choose wich items do you want to modify
  6. enable _blocks_ section if you want to modify block textures
    * choose wich blocks do you want to modify
  7. enbale _sound_ to modify entity's sound
_to modify texts and translations personally recomend SolveDev's Anylanguajes_ <https://solveddev.github.io/AnyLanguage/>

once all was selected click on **generate and download** to finish

### using customized mobs
this isn't implemented yet :P
